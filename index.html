    <h1>A Quick Summary about Me</h1>
    
    <p>
       <strong> Hello there internet user!</strong>
   
    <p
    >My name is Alyssa and am from Surrey, BC. I am currently a full-time student at B.C.I.T taking 
        the Computer Information Technology program. The reason I was interested in this program is 
            because I am hoping to get a career in Cyber-Security.
    </p>
           
    
    <p> Aside from what my educational goals are 
         I would also like to start some type of photogrpahy business in the future as taking pictures
             has always been one of my <em> favourite </em >hobbies. 

             </p>
