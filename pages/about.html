    <h1>A Quick Summary about Me</h1>
    
<p>
<strong> Hello there internet user!</strong>
</p>

<p>   
My name is Alyssa and am from Surrey, BC. I am currently a full-time student at B.C.I.T taking 
the Computer Information Technology program. The reason I was interested in this program is 
because I am hoping to get a career in Cyber-Security.</p>

<p> Aside from what my educational goals are 
I would also like to start some type of photogrpahy business in the future as taking pictures
has always been one of my <em> favourite </em >hobbies.
